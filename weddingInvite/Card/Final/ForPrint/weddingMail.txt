Hi Micheal

I'm sending on the updated  wedding invites. My partner made a few changes,
so its now doubled sided. I know you said you would do it as a favour but
if you need to charge for it due to the changes please fire away.

Seems I cant send the last files via email as they are to big. So I'm sending you a link to download a zipped file of the 3 files. Any problems give me a ring.
